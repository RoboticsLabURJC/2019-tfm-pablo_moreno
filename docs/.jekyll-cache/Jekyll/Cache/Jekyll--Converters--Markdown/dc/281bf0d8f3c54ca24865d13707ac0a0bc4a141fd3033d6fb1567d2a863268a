I"ú<p>Hi again!
On my first week doing different stuff I had to read a TFG of one of my partners named RubÃ©n Ãlvarez. He made an amazing job and explained so much interesting things about kibotics organization, wich is where I belong.</p>

<p>Also, I had to test some code about screen sharing to develop on kibotics practices. I had tested some codes but they werenâ€™t useful so I finally found an insteresting code from <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/">Muaz Khan</a> who uses <strong>WebRTC</strong> and It doesnâ€™t need any extrension or plugin at the browser. Iâ€™ve modifed the code to add JdeRobot information instead of him. You can watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GloVpVrjjOk">here</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been learning about <strong>WebSocket</strong> and Iâ€™ve made a simple Server and Client communication:</p>

<p>And thatâ€™s all about this week!</p>
