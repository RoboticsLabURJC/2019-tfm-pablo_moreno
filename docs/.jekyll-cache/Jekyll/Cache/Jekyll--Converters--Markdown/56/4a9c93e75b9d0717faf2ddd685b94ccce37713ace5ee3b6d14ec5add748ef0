I"€<p>Hi again!
On my first week doing different stuff I had to read a TFG of one of my partners named Rub√©n √Ålvarez. He made an amazing job and explained so much interesting things about kibotics organization, wich is where I belong.</p>

<p>Also, I had to test some code about screen sharing to develop on kibotics practices. I had tested some codes but they weren‚Äôt useful so I finally found an insteresting code from <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/">Muaz Khan</a> who uses <strong>WebRTC</strong> and It doesn‚Äôt need any extrension or plugin at the browser. I‚Äôve modifed the code to add JdeRobot information instead of him. You can watch the video clicking in the follow image:</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been learning about <strong>WebSocket</strong> and I‚Äôve made a simple Server and Client communication:</p>
