I"ê<p>Hi again!
On my first week doing different stuff I had to read a TFG of one of my partners named Rub√©n √Ålvarez. He made an amazing job and explained so much interesting things about kibotics organization, wich is where I belong.</p>

<p>Also, I had to test some code about screen sharing to develop on kibotics practices. I had tested some codes but they weren‚Äôt useful so I finally found an insteresting code from <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/">Muaz Khan</a> who uses <strong>WebRTC</strong> and It doesn‚Äôt need any extrension or plugin at the browser. I‚Äôve modifed the code to add JdeRobot information instead of him. You can watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GloVpVrjjOk">here</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been learning about <strong>WebSocket</strong> and I‚Äôve made a simple Server and Client communication:</p>
